# Arduino Uno LED Blink - Tinkercad Simulation

This project demonstrates how to make an LED blink using an Arduino Uno and a resistor. The project is built and simulated using Tinkercad's virtual platform, providing a simple introduction to controlling an LED with code.

## Project Description

The project involves connecting an LED to the Arduino Uno and programming it to blink at regular intervals. This basic circuit is an essential starting point for understanding Arduino's digital output and how to control external components like LEDs.

### Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- LED
- 220Ω Resistor (or a suitable resistor for the LED)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### Circuit Explanation:
- The LED's anode (longer leg) is connected to one of the Arduino's digital pins (e.g., pin 13).
- The cathode (shorter leg) is connected to the ground through a 220Ω resistor to limit current and protect the LED.
- The Arduino code is programmed to turn the LED on for one second and then off for one second, repeating this cycle.
