# Arduino Uno with 16x2 LCD Display - Tinkercad Simulation

This project demonstrates how to use a 16x2 LCD display with an Arduino Uno to display custom sentences. The project was built and simulated using Tinkercad's virtual simulator.

## Project Description

Using the Arduino Uno, this project controls a 16x2 LCD to display sentences. It's an excellent starting point for learning how to interface with LCDs in embedded systems using Arduino. The Tinkercad platform was used to virtually simulate the connections and code.

### Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Potentiometer (for contrast control)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

### How It Works:
1. The 16x2 LCD is connected to the Arduino using standard connections (RS, E, D4-D7).
2. The Arduino code frames sentences and displays them on the LCD.
3. Tinkercad's virtual simulator was used to design and test the circuit.
